  <h2>Adaptive Cloud Governance & FinOps Intelligence</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    MyOps is an AI-intelligent Cloud Governance, Compliance, and FinOps platform
    built for real enterprise Azure environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    It unifies intelligent tagging (TagOps), governance enforcement,
    and financial accountability into a single operational intelligence layer —
    without disrupting engineering teams.

<!-- ================= WHY MYOPS ================= -->
<section class="product-section">
  <h3>Why MyOps Exists</h3>

  <p>
    Cloud environments grow organically — across subscriptions, teams, regions,
    and workloads. Over time, governance becomes fragmented and cost visibility
    breaks down.
  </p>

  <p>
    MyOps continuously understands how your Azure estate is structured and used,
    then adapts governance rules, tagging intelligence, and FinOps insights as the
    environment evolves.
